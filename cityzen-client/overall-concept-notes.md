## client
- multiple client endpoints expected in future
- client might be: a js widget that shows on any site, wp plugin, mobile app, any other client that can access an API
- currently a vue based webapp is in development for the Fledge
    - external styles should match with [thefledge.com](https://thefledge.com) website style
    - accept task and track without sign-in (user token/id?) some tracking is needed for reporting
- task acceptance should be allowed without login
- should entry of a valid user token be a form of authentication?  ie: no 'unauthenticated' user actions, just configure what is needed to be 'authenticated'
